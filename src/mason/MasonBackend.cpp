    // GCode generation proceeds in several stages:
    // 1. Model is sliced into thin slices to make a volumetric representation of the object (VolumeStore).
    // 2. The model is converted to a wire plan.  These sub-stages can be interleaved.
    // 2a. The VolumeStore is split into annotated pieces that describe the roles of various subvolumes.
    //     This does things like idetify where the shell ends, areas of overhang, etc.  This stage does
    //     not modify the volume, only subdivide it.
    // 2b. The annotated VolumeStore is modified to add things like support, identify bridged areas, deal
    //     with too small regions, etc.  This stage modifies the volume to reflect what will actually be printed.
    //     Special regions may be created that have pre-calculated wire sequences.
    // 2c. The modified VolumeStore is filled with wires and wire sequences (indivisible sequences of wires).
    //     Typical wires specify a w x l x d box that should be filled.  Some of the box might be filled
    //     before the wire is printed.  Flow rate is adjusted to make this work.
    // 3. The wire plan is converted to a tool head plan.
    // 4. The tool head plan is converted to GCode.
